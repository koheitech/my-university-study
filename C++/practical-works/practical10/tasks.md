# Practical10 - Recursion -

## Task1
Write a function that checks if a word entered by the user is palindrome or not. Write a main program that uses this function.

## Task2
Write a recursive function to compute the following series: 
`m(i) = 1 + 1/2 + ... 1/i`
Write a test program that displays m(i) for `i=1, 2, ..., 10`.

## Task3
Write a recursive function to count the number of times a character appears in a word. Write a main program that uses this function. The use enters the character and the word. (Hint: Use Ex1 as a guideline).
