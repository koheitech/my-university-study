# Practical8 - Pointer -

## Task1
Use pointers to write a void function named `remove()` that deletes all occurrences of a character from a C-string. The function should use two parameters: the C-string and the character to be removed. For example if str contains the C-string `Happy Holidays`, the function call `remove(str, ‘H’)` should change the string str to `appy olidays`. 

## Task2
Write a void function that uses pointers that adds a single character to the end of a string. The function `Append(char *s, char ch)`takes the string and the character as input. Write a main program that uses this function.

## Task3
Write a function reverses an array using pointers. The array should be hard-coded inside the main function. For the function, use the following prototype
`int* reverse(int* list, int size)`
You should also define a function `printArray(int* const list, int size)` that print the array. Use both functions in a main program.
