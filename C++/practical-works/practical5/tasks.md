# Practical5 - C string -

## Task1
Write a function that finds the number of occurrences of a specified character in a C-string using the following header:
`int count(char s[], char a)`
Write a test program that reads a string and a character and displays the number of occurrences of the character in the string.

## Task2
Write a function that converts a binary number into decimal. Write a program that uses this function after asking the user to enter a string.

## Task3
Write a function that given two strings s1 and s2 checks if s1 is a substring of s2. The function should return -1 if s1 is not a substring of s2 and the position in s2 where s1 starts. Write a main program that uses this function after asking the user to enter the two strings.

## Task4
Write a function that, given two strings, identifies if the two strings have a common prefix. For example, the words “autopilot” and “autobiography” have a common prefix which is “auto”. The functions should be like follows:
`void prefix(char s1[], char s2[], char commonPrefix[])`
Write a main program that that uses this function after asking from the user two strings. If there is no common prefix, the program should print the appropriate message.
